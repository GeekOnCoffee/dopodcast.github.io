<p>&ldquo;do&rdquo; is a podcast about Ruby, Rubyists and their culture.  We hope to grow to
be a regular (at this stage, two-weekly) show, with a rotating panel of up to
10 people.</p>

<h2>Get involved.</h2>

<p>The show schedule is managed in our <a href="https://github.com/do-podcast/do-podcast.github.io/issues">GitHub issues</a>,
ideas for future shows can also be raised as issues for discussion, and may
wind up being assigned to the schedule (issue milestones) for future recording.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how you can get involved:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you&rsquo;d like to be on a panel, add yourself to the panel list of
an <a href="https://github.com/do-podcast/do-podcast.github.io/issues?labels=not+yet+recorded&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">upcoming show</a>.
<em>no more than 5 panelists, plus guest per show please!</em></p></li>
<li><p>If you&rsquo;d like to be present at the recording of one of our episodes? Just
